			The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks
			that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link
			several billion devices worldwide. It is an international network of
			networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic,
			business, and government packet switched networks, linked by a broad
			array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.
			The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and
			services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and
			applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), the infrastructure to
			support email, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing and
			telephony.
